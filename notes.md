## bugs

- [x] fix streams sometimes ending early with no error (fixed by using lavalink)
  - at the moment, the queue player tries to advance immediately when going idle. it should wait a bit (presumably for the network to wake up again), _then_ advance if still idle
- [x] errors get shown twice
- [x] sometimes 403 happens and stops the stream, but if seeking works, can use that as a form of recovery (fixed with lavalink)
- [x] retry on 403 when running ytdl
- [x] don't show "0 skipped"
